## **Tasks and Marks Distribution**

### **A. Binary Classification Using Handcrafted Features and ML Classifiers (4 Marks)**
- ‚úî Extract handcrafted features from the dataset.
- ‚úî Train and evaluate at least **two machine learning classifiers** (e.g., **SVM, Neural Network**) to classify faces as **"with mask"** or **"without mask."**
- ‚úî Report and compare the accuracy of the classifiers.

### **B. Binary Classification Using CNN (3 Marks)**
- ‚úî Design and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for binary classification.
- ‚úî Experiment with **hyperparameter variations** (e.g., learning rate, batch size, optimizer, activation function in the classification layer) and report results.
- ‚úî Compare the CNN's performance with the ML classifiers.

### **C. Region Segmentation Using Traditional Techniques (3 Marks)**
- ‚úî Implement a **region-based segmentation method** (e.g., **thresholding, edge detection**) for segmenting mask regions in faces identified as **"with mask."**
- ‚úî Visualize and evaluate the segmentation results.

### **D. Mask Segmentation Using U-Net (5 Marks)**
- ‚úî Train a **U-Net model** for precise segmentation of mask regions in images.
- ‚úî Compare the **U-Net performance** with the traditional segmentation method using **metrics like IoU or Dice score.**
