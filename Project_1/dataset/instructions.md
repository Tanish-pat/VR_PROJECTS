**Dataset Structure Instructions**
=====================================

To set up the dataset, please follow these steps:

1. Download the following datasets:
	* MSFD: [https://github.com/sadjadrz/MFSD]
	* with_mask: [https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection/tree/master/dataset]
	* without_mask: [https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection/tree/master/dataset]
2. Unzip the downloaded datasets in the current directory.
3. Ensure that only the following three folders are present:
	* MSFD
	* with_mask
	* without_mask

Here is the expected directory structure:

```
